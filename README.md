Generative Art NFTs examples using p5.js

This is a set of generative art NFTs I created for my fxhash artist page.
You can find my artworks at https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Andrew0

- Rename the specific script you want to run as index.js, then launch the artwork from index.html

- The index.js files were the actual scripts I created to generate the artworks, but you also need, in the same directory, the index.html file and the p5.js file (standard files provided by fxhash in order to make the script correctly run). 

- I used fxrand() instead of Math.random() because it's used by Fxhash to generate random tokens for each NFT minted.
